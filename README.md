Abstract:
The Avagrows Inventory Tracker is a web application that tracks parts of the Avagrows Bytes, an automated pod-based garden. It allows users to search, sort and filter a database for raw materials, work in progress parts, and finished bytes. A feature will be able to convert raw materials into work in progress parts and work in progress parts to completed Bytes. Users will also have the ability to disassemble complete bytes and work in progress parts into their base parts. In addition to all this, the users will be able to update the location of the parts as well as the statuses of the item. Users will also be able to access a log of changes to see which users made the change.

Overview of Existing Systems:
The problem with this application is aiming to make the tracking of Avagrows inventory easier. The current way they are handling this is in excel sheets and google forms. The application will be used by the employees of Avagrows, specifically their operations and engineering departments.

How to improve on Existing Systems:
This application will make it easier to filter through the inventory as well as add quality of life features like converting and un-converting types of inventory between each other and introducing a log of changes. Additionally, it will have a cleaner user interface that is easier to use versus messing with cells and functions in Excel.

Scope of our project:
This project has one main feature with a few subproblems. Our main feature is being able to track inventory while the sub-features include: search, sort, and filtering of the database,  converting raw materials into work in progress parts, working parts into finished products and vice versa, as well as updating location and statuses of the parts and have logs to see what changes were made. 
 
Stories:
    
Examples of stories for our project include a story for login, database filtering/searching, combining parts, how to attach statuses for parts, how logging works and changing the location of a part. The amount of work is suitable for 5 group members.

Login: Given a login screen, as a user, I would like to log into the system and be taken to the dashboard so that I can proceed to track my inventory.

Database filter/search: Given a database of materials as a user I would like to be able to filter and  search the database so that I can assess my inventory.

Attaching statuses: Given a part, as a user, I would like to attach a status to parts like scrap/inhouse/sellable so that I can quickly see the status of the item at a glance.

Combining parts: Given a set of raw materials, work in progress items, and finished products, as a user I would like to combine and disassemble these items into their respective components so that I can see how many finished products I can make.

Logging: Given a set of actions, as a user I would like to be able to show logs of who made changes so that I can have a record of who made changes.

Changing location: Given a location of a part, as a user, I would like to be able to change the location of the part so that I can manage parts in different locations more easily
